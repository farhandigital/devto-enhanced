[![Built with WXT](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-WXT-7c3aed)](https://wxt.dev/)

A browser extension that transforms your [dev.to](https://dev.to) reading experience with decluttering tools, enhanced navigation, and other tools.

---

## ✨ Features

All features are **fully toggleable** via the extension popup menu, with preferences automatically persisted to browser storage and synchronized in real-time across tabs.

### 🌐 Global Features

- **Hide Subforem Switcher** — Remove the Subforem navigation menu for a cleaner interface

### 📖 Article Page Features

- **Hide Right Sidebar** — Remove distracting sidebar content to focus on the article
- **Move Engagement Buttons** — Relocate like/comment/save buttons to appear below the article title for easier access
- **Sticky Table of Contents** — Auto-generate a dynamic, scrollspy-enabled table of contents in the right sidebar that:
  - Includes all headings (H1-H6) from the article
  - Highlights the currently active section as you scroll
  - Provides smooth scroll navigation to any section
  - Automatically generates IDs for headings without them
- **Reading Statistics** — Display word count and estimated reading time (based on 225 WPM) below the article title
- **Copy Article Button** — One-click button to copy the entire article in Markdown format, including:
  - Formatted text with proper heading levels
  - Code blocks with syntax preservation
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
  - Links, bold, italic, and inline code
  - Author attribution and article URL
- **Center Article** — Center the article content when sidebars are hidden (requires right sidebar hidden AND ToC disabled)

### 🏠 Homepage Features

- **Hide Left Sidebar** — Remove the left navigation sidebar for a cleaner feed view
- **Hide Right Sidebar** — Remove the right sidebar for a distraction-free browsing experience

## 🎯 How It Works

The extension uses a feature registry system to:

1. **Apply CSS-based Layouts** — Dynamically toggle CSS classes on the document body to hide/show elements based on page context
2. **Inject Dynamic Features** — Render UI enhancements (ToC, reading stats, copy button) directly into the page DOM
3. **Handle SPA Navigation** — Monitor DOM changes and URL transitions to re-apply features when navigating between pages (dev.to uses SPA-style navigation)

### Adding New Features

The extension uses a declarative feature registry system with a split between metadata and implementation to optimize popup performance. To add a new feature:

1. **Define the Metadata**:

   Add the definition to **BOTH** `src/features/feature-definitions.ts` (for content script) and `src/features/metadata.ts` (for popup).

   > **Note**: Metadata must be manually duplicated in `metadata.ts` to keep the popup bundle completely decoupled and instant.

   ```typescript
   {
    name: "yourFeature",
    context: ["article"], // or ["home", "global"]
    type: "add", // or "hide"
    settingKey: { section: "article", key: "yourFeature" },
    label: "Your Feature Label",
   },
   ```

2. **Create the Implementation** in `src/features/yourFeature.ts`:

```typescript
export function handleYourFeature(settings: ExtensionSettings) {
  // Your feature logic here
}
```

3. **Register the Implementation** in `src/features/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Import your function
import { handleYourFeature } from "./yourFeature";

// Add to the executeMap
const executeMap: Record<string, (settings: ExtensionSettings) => void> = {
  // ...
  yourFeature: handleYourFeature,
};
```

4. **Add the Type Definitions** in `src/types/settings.ts`:

```typescript
export interface ExtensionSettings {
  article: {
    // ... existing settings
    yourFeature: boolean;
  };
}
```

The feature will now automatically appear in the popup (using metadata) and execute in the content script (using the implementation)!

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Feature Registry System

The extension uses a centralized feature registry that enables:

- **Declarative feature definitions** — Register features with metadata (name, context, type, settings)
- **Automatic orchestration** — Features are executed based on page context without manual coordination
- **Type-safe settings** — Full TypeScript support for all feature configurations
- **Dynamic UI generation** — Popup interface is automatically generated from registered features

### Context-Aware Execution

Features are registered with specific contexts:

- **Global** — Execute on all dev.to pages
- **Article** — Execute only on article pages
- **Home** — Execute only on the homepage

### Mutation Observer with Smart Filtering

The content script uses a MutationObserver to detect SPA navigation, but includes intelligent filtering to:

- Ignore mutations from the extension's own injected elements
- Only react to significant DOM changes (page transitions)
- Prevent infinite loops from self-triggered mutations
- Skip irrelevant changes (ads, lazy-loaded content)

### CSS-First Approach for Layout Changes

Layout modifications (hiding sidebars, centering content) are implemented primarily through CSS classes toggled on the `<body>` element. This provides:

- **Better performance** — No DOM manipulation for simple visibility changes
- **Smooth transitions** — CSS animations for better UX
- **Maintainability** — Centralized styles in `devto.css`
