# DEV.to Enhanced v0.3.0 - Release Notes

## 🚀 What's New

### Performance Improvements
- **Instant Popup Opening**: Eliminated the ~300ms cold-start delay when opening the extension popup for the first time per tab. The popup now opens instantaneously every time.

### Bug Fixes
- **Table of Contents Auto-Scroll**: Fixed unwanted snap-back behavior when scrolling near the top of articles. The ToC now scrolls smoothly without interfering with page navigation.
- **Reaction Drawer Positioning**: Fixed visual regression where the reaction drawer (tooltip showing reaction options) appeared in the wrong location when the "Move Engagement Buttons" feature was enabled.
